Posting in classic is identical to standard jekyll.

The home page is a little different in the sense that it will show the complete 5 most recent posts. It also has a widget in the left column that shows links to the 10 most recent posts.

In `_config.yml` there are two parameters that control these numbers:

- `number-of-recent-posts-in-widget`: For the number of most recent posts in the widget.
- `number-of-posts-on-home-page`: For the number of most recent posts on the home page.
