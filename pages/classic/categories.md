The "Categories" navigation menu is created automatically. However the website designer has to specify which categories must be included in the menu. This can be done by adding a page with the layout set to "category-page". This kicks off the creation of a page for the categorie specified in the `title` of that page's YAML matter.

The html content of that page will be ignored. An example can be seen in the `pages/categories/classic.md` file.
