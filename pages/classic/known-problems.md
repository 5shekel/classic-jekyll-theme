There is some odd behaviour in the navigation bar that I have not been able to nail down yet. It has to do with the space between top level menu items. There is some additional space that I am not able to trace down. For those who like a puzzle: there is some space around a ".navbanner-menu ul li" that has no obvious source. Please let me know if you happen to find where it comes from. (rien@balancingrock.nl)

It seems unlikely that this will ever be of real concern, so for the time being...
