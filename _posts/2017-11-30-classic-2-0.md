Just over a year has gone by since the first Classic release. Since then lots of detail has been added and bugfixes have been made.

With version 2.0 we have implemented even more features, but at a small price. The innards have been updated considerably, so if a site has made changes to the old innards, then some hands on may be required before this update runs the site.

The good news is two fold:

1. The YAML of the old version still works. So it is not necessary to update old content.
1. The new innards are considerably better separated, documented and simplified. It is hoped that this will help to make the transition easier, and will be of even more value going forward.

New features (since 1.9.4):

1. The navigation banner can now be fixed at the top of the browser window.
1. A vertical menu can be activated by disabling the drop-down menu. This vertical menu will appear on top of the secondary column or the primary column, depending on the screen width.
1. A categories widget has been added to replace the categories menu entry.
1. The categories menu entry is still available through a setup parameter if the drop-down menus are enabled.
1. The vertical menu now allows three levels of menu entries. The first level stays in the menu bar. The second level is the top level in the vertical menu, the third level is sub-level in the vertical menu.
1. All menu levels are controlled from the YAML front matter. But it is possible to construct the entire menu configuration in a single page.
