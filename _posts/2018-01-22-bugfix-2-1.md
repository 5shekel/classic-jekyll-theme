This release fixes issues #11 and #13

There is a small additional benefit that fixing #13 also created the opportunity for a slight performance improvement that may be noticeable on sites that use many pages.

The changed files are:

- _includes/menubar.html
- _includes/widgets/categories.html

This release is fully backward compatible with the previous release. Upgrading is recommended for all users.

Note for Rubygems users: due a mixup this release is identical to release 2.1.1 on rubygems.
