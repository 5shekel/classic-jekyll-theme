This release fixes a problem where the landing page selection (for top menu items) in v2.0.0 did not evaluate the "menuInclude" tag correctly.

There is a small additional benefit that fixing this bug also created the opportunity for a slight performance improvement that may be noticeable on sites that use many pages.

The only file that was changed is `_includes/menubar.html`.

This release is fully backward compatible with the previous release. Upgrading is recommended for all users.
