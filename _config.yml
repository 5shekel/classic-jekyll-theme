# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing these this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.
title: Your awesome title
email: your-email@domain.com
description: > # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  Write an awesome description for your new site here. You can edit this
  line in _config.yml. It will appear in your document head meta (for
  Google search results) and in your feed.xml site description.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com

# Classic Jekyll Theme settings

# Classic uses three columns Primary, Secondary and Tertiary.
# The primary column is always present and cannot be manipulated.
# The secondary column is optional and is either to the left or to the right of the primary.
# The tertiary column is optional and if present will be opposite the secondary column in the wide display and below the secondary in the medium display.
# In the narrow display all three columns will be below each other (if present)
# If the tertiary column is used, the secondary column *must* also be used.

secondary_column: left # must be either 'left', 'right' or 'none', other values are illegal.
tertiary_column: present # must be either 'present' or 'none', other values are illegal.
