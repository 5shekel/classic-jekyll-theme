# Classic uses three columns Primary, Secondary and Tertiary.
# The primary column is always present and cannot be manipulated.
# The secondary column is optional and is either to the left or to the right of the primary.
# The tertiary column is optional and if present will be opposite the secondary column in the wide display and below the secondary in the medium display.
# In the narrow display all three columns will be below each other (if present)
# If the tertiary column is used, the secondary column *must* also be used.
